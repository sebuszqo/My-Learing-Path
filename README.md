<h1 align='center'> My-Learning-Path </h1>

<h3 align='center'> Here I am making public almost every piece of code that I've written during learning: </h5>
<h5 align='center'> JavaScript Node.js  Express.js  MYSQL & MongoDB  TypeScript  React  NestJS </h5>

- Each stage is divided into approximately 30 days of learning new things, part of the code that I wrote during learning is in this repository.

- Unfortunately, I don't have the code of day-to-day progress, sometimes learning a few days was written in one file or during these 30 days I was doing some projects which are available to see in a repository named 'Projects'. 

- Smaller projects that I have made during learning are available in this or another repository (Projects).
