# My-Learning-Path
Here I am making public almost every piece of code that I've written during learning: 
JavaScript/ Node.js / Express.js / MYSQL & MONGODB / TypeScript / React / NestJS

Each stage is divided into approximately 30 days of learing new things.

Smaller projects that I have made during learing are available in this or another repository (Projects).

I've started: 21.03.2022
