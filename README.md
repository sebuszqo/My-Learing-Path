<h1 align='center'> My-Learning-Path </h1>

<h2 align='center'> Here I'm making public almost every piece of code that I've written during learning: </h2>
<h3 align='center'> JavaScript / Node.js / Express.js / MYSQL & MongoDB / TypeScript / React / NestJS </h3>

- Each stage is divided into approximately 30 days of learning new things, part of the code that I wrote during learning is in this repository.

- Unfortunately, I don't have the code of day-to-day progress, sometimes learning a few days was written in one file or during these 30 days I was doing some projects which are available to see in a repository -->:

- --> Smaller projects that I have made during learning are available in this or another repository (Projects).

- The thing is that i cloned my smaller Projects form "Projects" repository here to have everything in one repository to link my work
